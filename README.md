# 🏠 House Price & Income Prediction with Regression

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains two machine learning projects aimed at understanding and applying regression techniques on real-world data:

1. **Polynomial Regression on Income Dataset** - Demonstrates how non-linear relationships can be modeled using polynomial regression.
2. **House Price Prediction** - Uses Linear Regression to predict housing prices based on various features.

## 🔬 Project Highlights

### 📊 Polynomial Regression
- Used to fit non-linear trends in income data.
- Visual comparison between linear and polynomial fits.
- Highlights issues of overfitting with higher degrees.

### 🏠 House Price Prediction
- Trained a Linear Regression model on a housing dataset.
- Performed data preprocessing and visualization.
- Evaluated model performance using R² score.
